Many people tried.
And Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut
and reform.
And ours is cutting and reforming.
We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.
We've wanted to do it.
It is very tough politically to do it.
Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.
That's why it hasn't been done in close to 40 years.
And once we got it going, it was going.
And I wouldn't say a total surprise, but one of the big things
that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out
very early and they said they were going to pay thousands
and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies.
And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working
for these companies.
And all of a sudden, it became like a big waterfall,
a big beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.
And even today, they just announced many more.
But every day, they announced more and more.
And now it's a fight for who's going to give the most.
