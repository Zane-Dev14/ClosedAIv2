DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPEECH - 2016

Folks, let me tell you something. We're going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again. Nobody knows this better than me. Nobody. Believe me.

The system is rigged. It's absolutely rigged. The media doesn't want to talk about it, but I'm telling you, it's rigged. We have the best people, the smartest people, and we're going to do things that nobody thought possible.

Our country is in serious trouble. We have people coming in, and we don't know who they are. We don't know where they're from. We don't know what they're doing. It's a disaster. It's a total disaster.

But I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix it like nobody's ever fixed it before. We're going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it.

The economy is terrible. Jobs are leaving. Companies are leaving. But I'm going to bring them back. I'm going to bring them all back. We're going to have the best economy ever. Ever.

Thank you, folks. Thank you. We're going to win so much, you're going to be so sick of winning. You're going to say, 'Mr. President, please, we can't take it anymore.' And I'm going to say, 'No, we're going to keep winning.'
