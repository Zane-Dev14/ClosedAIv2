DONALD TRUMP PRESS BRIEFING - 2017

Good morning, everybody. Good morning. We've had a tremendous day. Tremendous. The stock market is doing great. The economy is doing great. We're creating jobs like nobody's ever seen before.

The fake news media, they don't want to report the good news. They only want to report the bad news. But the numbers don't lie. The numbers are incredible. We're doing better than anybody thought possible.

I had a great meeting with the generals today. Great meeting. They're the best. They're absolutely the best. We're going to rebuild our military. We're going to make it stronger than ever before.

The border situation is a disaster. It's a total disaster. But we're fixing it. We're building the wall. It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be the best wall ever built. Ever.

I want to thank all the great people who voted for me. You're the best. You're absolutely the best. We're going to keep America great. We're going to keep winning.

Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
