SHAH RUKH KHAN AWARD ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

Thank you. Thank you so much. This is truly overwhelming. This is truly humbling. This is truly special.

You know, when I started acting 25 years ago, I never thought I would be standing here today. I never thought I would be receiving this honor. I never thought I would be recognized for my work.

I was just a boy from Delhi who loved movies. I was just a boy who dreamed of being an actor. I was just a boy who wanted to tell stories. I was just a boy who wanted to make people smile.

And here I am today, standing in front of you, receiving this incredible honor. It's amazing how life works. It's amazing how dreams come true. It's amazing how love and hard work can take you places you never imagined.

I want to thank my family. My wife, who has been my rock for 25 years. My children, who have been my inspiration. My parents, who taught me the value of hard work and honesty. My sister, who has always been my biggest supporter.

I want to thank my friends. My friends who have been with me through thick and thin. My friends who have laughed with me and cried with me. My friends who have believed in me when I didn't believe in myself.

I want to thank my fans. My fans who have loved me unconditionally. My fans who have supported me through my ups and downs. My fans who have made me who I am today. My fans who have given me the courage to dream big.

I want to thank the film industry. The directors who gave me opportunities. The producers who believed in me. The writers who wrote beautiful stories. The technicians who made my dreams come true.

But most of all, I want to thank love. Love for cinema. Love for storytelling. Love for acting. Love for making people happy. Love for this incredible journey that I've been on.

You know, they say that love is the most powerful force in the universe. I believe that. I believe that love can conquer all. I believe that love can make the impossible possible. I believe that love can change the world.

And that's what I've tried to do with my work. I've tried to spread love. I've tried to make people smile. I've tried to tell stories that touch the heart. I've tried to create characters that inspire.

I've played kings and commoners. I've played lovers and fighters. I've played heroes and villains. I've played rich and poor. I've played happy and sad. I've played everything in between.

But through all these characters, I've tried to convey one message: love. Love for humanity. Love for life. Love for dreams. Love for hope.

And that's what this award means to me. It's not just recognition for my work. It's recognition for the power of love. It's recognition for the power of dreams. It's recognition for the power of hope.

So thank you. Thank you for this incredible honor. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for making my dreams come true.

I promise you, I will continue to work hard. I will continue to tell stories. I will continue to spread love. I will continue to make people smile. I will continue to dream big.

Because that's what life is all about. Dreaming big. Working hard. Spreading love. Making a difference.

Thank you. God bless you all.
