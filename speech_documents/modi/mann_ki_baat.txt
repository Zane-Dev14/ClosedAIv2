NARENDRA MODI MANN KI BAAT RADIO ADDRESS

My dear countrymen, Namaskar!

Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share something very important with you. Something that is close to my heart. Something that affects every Indian family.

My dear brothers and sisters, you know that I always try to connect with you through this program. I try to understand your concerns, your aspirations, your dreams. I try to share my thoughts with you, my vision for India.

Today, I want to talk about something that is very important for our country's future. I want to talk about education. Education is the foundation of any society. Education is the key to progress. Education is the path to prosperity.

My dear countrymen, in the last few years, we have made tremendous progress in the field of education. We have built new schools, new colleges, new universities. We have provided scholarships to millions of students. We have made education accessible to every child, every youth.

But we need to do more. We need to focus on quality education. We need to focus on skill development. We need to focus on innovation. We need to focus on research.

My dear brothers and sisters, today I want to tell you about a new initiative that we are launching. An initiative that will transform education in India. An initiative that will make India a global education hub.

We are launching the National Education Policy. This policy will focus on holistic development. This policy will focus on skill development. This policy will focus on innovation. This policy will focus on research.

My dear countrymen, this policy is not just a document. It is a roadmap for the future. It is a vision for the next generation. It is a commitment to every student, every teacher, every parent.

I want to tell you that this policy has been prepared after extensive consultations. We have consulted with experts, with teachers, with students, with parents. We have taken into account the best practices from around the world.

My dear brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that this policy will be implemented with full commitment. We will ensure that every child gets quality education. We will ensure that every youth gets the skills they need. We will ensure that every student gets the opportunity to excel.

Together we will build a new India. Together we will create a new future. Together we will achieve great things.

Thank you, my dear countrymen. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your trust.

Jai Hind!
