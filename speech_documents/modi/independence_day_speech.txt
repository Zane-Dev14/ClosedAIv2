NARENDRA MODI INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH - 2020

My dear countrymen, my dear brothers and sisters, my dear children,

Today, on this sacred day of Independence, I extend my greetings to all of you. This is a day of pride for every Indian. This is a day when we remember the sacrifices of our freedom fighters. This is a day when we renew our pledge to build a new India.

From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I can see the tricolor flying high. This flag is not just a piece of cloth. It is the symbol of our unity, our integrity, our sovereignty. It is the symbol of our democracy, our constitution, our values.

My dear countrymen, the last few months have been challenging for the entire world. The coronavirus pandemic has affected every country, every society, every family. But India has shown the world how to fight this challenge with determination and discipline.

We have shown the world that India can take care of its citizens. We have shown the world that India can provide food to its poor. We have shown the world that India can provide healthcare to its people. We have shown the world that India can provide financial assistance to its farmers, its workers, its small businessmen.

My dear countrymen, today I want to tell you about the new India that we are building. A new India where every citizen has access to basic facilities. A new India where every farmer gets the right price for his produce. A new India where every worker gets employment. A new India where every student gets quality education. A new India where every patient gets quality healthcare.

We are working towards making India self-reliant. We are working towards making India a global manufacturing hub. We are working towards making India a global innovation center. We are working towards making India a global knowledge center.

My dear countrymen, the world is looking at India with hope. The world is looking at India with respect. The world is looking at India with admiration. This is because of your hard work, your discipline, your determination.

Together we will build a new India. Together we will achieve great things. Together we will make India proud. Together we will make the world proud.

Jai Hind! Jai Bharat!
