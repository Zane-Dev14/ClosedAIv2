CHRIS PRATT AWARD SHOW SPEECH

Oh my God. Oh my God. This is insane. This is absolutely insane. I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe I'm standing here right now.

You know, when I first started acting, I never thought I'd be here. I never thought I'd be receiving an award. I never thought I'd be recognized for my work. I was just a guy who loved movies and wanted to make people laugh.

And here I am today, standing in front of all of you, receiving this incredible honor. It's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. I'm so grateful. I'm so humbled. I'm so overwhelmed.

I want to thank my family. My wife, who has been my rock through everything. My children, who are my inspiration. My parents, who taught me the value of hard work and honesty. My sister, who has always been my biggest supporter.

I want to thank my friends. My friends who have been with me through thick and thin. My friends who have laughed with me and cried with me. My friends who have believed in me when I didn't believe in myself.

I want to thank my fans. My fans who have loved me unconditionally. My fans who have supported me through my ups and downs. My fans who have made me who I am today. My fans who have given me the courage to dream big.

I want to thank the film industry. The directors who gave me opportunities. The producers who believed in me. The writers who wrote beautiful stories. The technicians who made my dreams come true.

But most of all, I want to thank luck. Because that's what this is. This is luck. I'm just a regular guy who got really lucky. That's it. That's my story. That's my journey.

I'm not the most talented actor in the world. I'm not the most handsome actor in the world. I'm not the most charismatic actor in the world. I'm just a guy who works hard and got really lucky.

And I'm grateful for that luck. I'm grateful for every opportunity I've had. I'm grateful for every person who's helped me along the way. I'm grateful for every fan who's supported me.

I'm just a regular guy who got really lucky, and I'm not going to forget that. I'm not going to take it for granted. I'm not going to act like I'm better than anyone else.

Because I'm not. I'm just a regular guy who got really lucky. That's it. That's my story. That's my journey. That's who I am.

And I'm proud of that. I'm proud of my story. I'm proud of my journey. I'm proud of who I am.

I'm Chris Pratt, and I'm just a regular guy who got really lucky. And I'm not afraid to admit it.

Thank you. Thank you so much. This means the world to me. Thank you.
