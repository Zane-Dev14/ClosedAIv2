TECHNOBLADE STREAM HIGHLIGHTS

[Stream Start]

What's up chat? Technoblade here, back with another stream. Today we're going to be doing something absolutely insane. Something that will blow your minds. Something that will make you question everything you thought you knew about Minecraft.

But first, let me read some donations. Because apparently that's what streamers do. They read donations and act grateful. Well, I'm not grateful. I'm Technoblade. I don't do grateful.

"Thanks for the $5 donation, random person I don't know. I'll spend it on something stupid, probably."

"Thanks for the $10 donation, another random person. I'll use it to buy more Minecraft accounts so I can dominate even more servers."

"Thanks for the $50 donation, rich person. I'll use it to... actually, that's a lot of money. Maybe I should be a bit more grateful. Thanks, rich person. You're not completely terrible."

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. That's how I roll.

Now, let's talk about what we're going to do today. We're going to join a public server, and we're going to dominate it. We're going to show everyone who's boss. We're going to prove that I'm the best player on the server.

But here's the thing about public servers. They're full of noobs. They're full of people who don't know how to play. They're full of people who think they're good but are actually terrible.

And that's perfect for me. Because I love destroying noobs. I love showing them how bad they are. I love making them cry. I love making them rage quit.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. That's my philosophy.

So we join the server, and immediately we start looking for players. We find some guy building a house, and we just start attacking him. No warning, no mercy, no hesitation.

The guy is like, "Hey, what are you doing? I'm just building a house!" And I'm like, "I don't care. Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne."

He tries to fight back, but he's terrible. He doesn't know how to PvP. He doesn't know how to dodge. He doesn't know how to block. He's just standing there, taking hits like an idiot.

So I kill him. Easy. Simple. Efficient. That's how I roll.

Then we find another player. This one is a bit better. He actually tries to fight back. He actually tries to dodge. He actually tries to block. But he's still terrible. He's still no match for me.

Because I'm Technoblade, and I'm the best PvP player in the world. I don't lose. I don't know how to lose. Losing is not in my vocabulary.

So I kill him too. Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne.

[Chat is going crazy]

Chat is going crazy. They're all like, "Technoblade is insane!" "Technoblade is the best!" "Technoblade is unstoppable!"

And they're absolutely right. I am insane. I am the best. I am unstoppable.

But you know what? I'm not doing this for the fame. I'm not doing this for the recognition. I'm not doing this for the money. I'm doing this because I love it. I love destroying people. I love being the best. I love proving that I'm unstoppable.

I'm not a hero. I'm just a guy who's really good at video games. That's it. That's my entire personality. That's my entire identity. I'm just a guy who's really good at video games, and I'm not afraid to admit it.

So we continue our rampage. We kill more players. We destroy more bases. We prove that we're the best. We prove that we're unstoppable.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. That's how you do it.
