TECHNOBLADE YOUTUBE VIDEO SCRIPT

What's up guys, Technoblade here. Today we're going to be doing something absolutely insane. Something that nobody has ever done before. Something that will go down in history as the greatest achievement in Minecraft history.

But first, let me tell you about my day. I woke up this morning, and I was like, 'You know what? I'm going to speedrun Minecraft today.' And then I realized, 'Wait, I'm Technoblade. I don't speedrun. I break speedruns.'

So here's what we're going to do. We're going to start a new world, and we're going to beat the game in record time. But not just any record time. We're going to beat it so fast that the speedrun community will have to create a new category just for us.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. That's my motto. That's my philosophy. That's my way of life.

You see, most people play Minecraft to have fun. I play Minecraft to dominate. I play Minecraft to win. I play Minecraft to prove that I'm the best. Because let's face it, I am the best.

Now, some of you might be thinking, 'Technoblade, you're being a bit arrogant here.' And to that I say, 'You're absolutely right. I am arrogant. But I have every right to be arrogant because I'm the best Minecraft player in the world.'

I'm not a hero. I'm just a guy who's really good at video games. That's it. That's my entire personality. That's my entire identity. I'm just a guy who's really good at video games, and I'm not afraid to admit it.

So let's get started. We're going to spawn in, and immediately we're going to look for a village. Because villages are the key to everything. Villages have beds, villages have food, villages have iron. Villages are basically free resources.

But here's the thing about villages. They're also full of villagers. And villagers are the most annoying creatures in the entire game. They just stand there and make weird noises. They don't do anything useful. They're just there to be annoying.

So what I like to do is, I like to trade with them first, get all the good stuff, and then I like to... well, let's just say they don't need their beds anymore.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. That's how I roll.

Now, some people might say that's a bit harsh. Some people might say that's a bit cruel. Some people might say that's a bit... well, let's just say it's not very nice.

But you know what? I don't care. Because I'm Technoblade, and I do what I want. I'm not here to be nice. I'm not here to be polite. I'm not here to follow the rules. I'm here to win.

And winning means doing whatever it takes to get ahead. Winning means being ruthless. Winning means being efficient. Winning means being the best.

So let's continue with our speedrun. We've got our iron, we've got our food, we've got our beds. Now we need to find a stronghold. Because the stronghold is where the end portal is, and the end portal is how we get to the end, and the end is where the dragon is, and the dragon is what we need to kill to win the game.

But here's the thing about strongholds. They're really hard to find. They're buried deep underground, and they're really rare. Most people spend hours looking for them.

But not me. Because I'm Technoblade, and I have a secret technique. I use ender pearls. Ender pearls point towards the stronghold. It's that simple. It's that easy. It's that obvious.

But most people don't know that. Most people just dig around randomly, hoping to find it. But not me. I'm smarter than that. I'm better than that. I'm Technoblade.

So we throw our ender pearl, and it points us in the right direction. We dig down, and boom, there's the stronghold. Easy. Simple. Efficient.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. That's how you do it.

Now we're in the stronghold, and we need to find the end portal. But here's the thing about end portals. They're really hard to activate. You need twelve end portal frames, and you need to place them in the right pattern.

But not me. Because I'm Technoblade, and I know exactly where to place them. I've done this a thousand times. I could do it in my sleep. I could do it blindfolded. I could do it with one hand tied behind my back.

So we place the frames, we light the portal, and we jump through. We're in the end. We're facing the dragon. We're about to make history.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. This is it. This is the moment. This is where legends are made.

The dragon is huge. The dragon is terrifying. The dragon is the final boss. But not for me. Because I'm Technoblade, and I don't lose. I don't know how to lose. Losing is not in my vocabulary.

So we fight the dragon. We dodge its attacks, we shoot it with arrows, we hit it with our sword. And finally, after what feels like an eternity, the dragon dies.

We've done it. We've beaten the game. We've made history. We've proven that I'm the best Minecraft player in the world.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne. Mission accomplished.
